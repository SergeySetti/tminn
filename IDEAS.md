Brilliant approach! Keeping it simple as a stick is exactly right for this kind of experimental AI team - complexity is the enemy of emergent behavior.

A shared channel system with APScheduler makes total sense. You can have:

**Single shared state/channel** where all agents read/write updates
**Simple wake-up patterns** like:
- `schedule.every(30).minutes.do(pm_check_pulse)`
- `schedule.every(2).hours.do(se_code_review_cycle)`
- `schedule.every(4).hours.do(memory_refresh_all)`

The beauty is when things collapse (and they will!), you can easily see the failure patterns in the shared channel logs. Much easier to debug than complex inter-agent protocols.

For universal applicability, you're probably thinking something like:
- JSON messages in a shared queue/database
- Simple message types: `task_created`, `work_completed`, `help_needed`, `status_update`
- Each agent just polls their schedule, reads recent messages, processes, and writes back

The universality comes from the message format being project-agnostic - whether it's a web app, data pipeline, or mobile game, the team communication patterns stay the same.

Are you planning to start with a specific project type to validate the approach, or going straight for the universal framework? The "collapse and learn" strategy sounds like it'll generate great insights either way.
